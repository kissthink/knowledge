jquery浏览器兼容性
##################################


jQuery actively supports these browsers:
================================================
::

    Firefox Current - 1 version
    Internet Explorer 6+
    Safari Current - 1 version
    Opera Current - 1 version
    Chrome Current - 1 version
    Any problem with them should be considered and reported as a bug in jQuery.

There are known problems with:
===================================

    Mozilla Firefox 1.0.x
    Internet Explorer 1.0-5.x
    Safari 1.0-2.0.1
    Opera 1.0-9.x
    Konqueror
    jQuery generally works with Konqueror and Firefox 1.0.x, but there may be some unexpected bugs since we do not test them as regularly.
